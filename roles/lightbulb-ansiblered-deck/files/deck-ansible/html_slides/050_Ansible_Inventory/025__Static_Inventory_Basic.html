            <p>Static inventory is the easiest source to get started with. This example shows a static inventory source in It&rsquo;s simplest form &ndash; a single file with a list of IP addresses or hostnames.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Ansible infers a localhost is present even if it is not explicitly listed. This is why you can actually run Ansible without a inventory source. Ansible will only be able to operate on the localhost where it is being run.</p>
