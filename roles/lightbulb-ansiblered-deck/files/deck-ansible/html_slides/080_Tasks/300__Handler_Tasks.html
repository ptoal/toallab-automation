  <h2>Handler Tasks</h2>
  <p>Handlers are special tasks that run at the end of a play if notified by another task when a change occurs.</p>
  <blockquote>If a package gets installed or updated, notify a service restart task that it needs to run.</blockquote>
  <aside class="notes">
	<p>Normal tasks run sequentially; handler tasks run on notification of a change and will only run once at the end of a play.</p>
