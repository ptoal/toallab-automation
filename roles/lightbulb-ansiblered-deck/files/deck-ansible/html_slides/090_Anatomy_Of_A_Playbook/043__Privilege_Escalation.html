            <p>Ansible allows you to &quot;become&quot; another user or with elevated rights to execute a task or an entire play (shown above). This is done using existing privilege escalation tools, which you probably already use or have configured, like sudo (the default), su, pfexec, doas, pbrun, dzdo, ksu and others.</p>
            <p>For more details see <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/become.html">the Privilege Escalation page</a> in the Ansible documentation.</p>
