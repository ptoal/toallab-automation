            <p>Playbooks are written in YAML and are used to invoke Ansible modules to perform tasks that are executed sequentially i.e top to bottom. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of steps in a general IT workflow. Playbooks are like an instruction manual and describe the state of environment.</p>
            <p>For more details see <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html">the Playbook page</a> in the Ansible documentation.</p>
