            <p>Continuing our metaphor, plugins are the gears in the engine.</p>
            <p>Plugins are pieces of code that extend Ansibleâ€™s core functionality. Ansible ships with a number of handy plugins, and you can easily write your own.</p>
            <p>These are some of the more common plugin types:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Action plugins manage the execution on the controller and deployment of modules to hosts.</li>
            <li>Callback plugins enable you to hook into Ansible events for display or logging purposes.</li>
            <li>Connection plugins define how to communicate with inventory hosts.</li>
            <li>Filters plugins allow you to manipulate data inside Ansible plays and/or templates. This is a Jinja2 feature; Ansible ships extra filter plugins.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For more details see the <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/dev_guide/developing_plugins.html">Developing Plugins</a> page in the Ansible documentation.</p>
