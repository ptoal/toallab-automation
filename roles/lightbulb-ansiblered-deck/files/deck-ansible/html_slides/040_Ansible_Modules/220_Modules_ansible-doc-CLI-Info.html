> COPY    (/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/modules/files/copy.py)

        The `copy' module copies a file from the local or remote machine to a
        location on the remote machine. Use the [fetch] module to copy files
        from remote locations to the local box. If you need variable
        interpolation in copied files, use the [template] module. For Windows
        targets, use the [win_copy] module instead.

  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- attributes
        Attributes the file or directory should have. To get supported flags
        look at the man page for `chattr' on the target system. This string
        should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by
        `lsattr'.
        (Aliases: attr)[Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.3

- backup
        Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get
        the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 0.7

- checksum
        SHA1 checksum of the file being transferred. Used to validate that the
        copy of the file was successful.
        If this is not provided, ansible will use the local calculated checksum
        of the src file.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 2.5

- content
        When used instead of `src', sets the contents of a file directly to the
        specified value. For anything advanced or with formatting also look at
        the template module.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 1.1

- decrypt
        This option controls the autodecryption of source files using vault.
        [Default: Yes]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.4

= dest
        Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If `src' is a
        directory, this must be a directory too. If `dest' is a nonexistent path
        and if either `dest' ends with "/" or `src' is a directory, `dest' is
        created. If `src' and `dest' are files, the parent directory of `dest'
        isn't created: the task fails if it doesn't already exist.


- directory_mode
        When doing a recursive copy set the mode for the directories. If this is
        not set we will use the system defaults. The mode is only set on
        directories which are newly created, and will not affect those that
        already existed.
        [Default: (null)]
        version_added: 1.5

- follow
        This flag indicates that filesystem links in the destination, if they
        exist, should be followed.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.8

- force
        the default is `yes', which will replace the remote file when contents
        are different than the source. If `no', the file will only be
        transferred if the destination does not exist.
        (Aliases: thirsty)[Default: yes]
        type: bool
        version_added: 1.1

- group
        Name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to
        `chown'.
        [Default: (null)]

- local_follow
        This flag indicates that filesystem links in the source tree, if they
        exist, should be followed.
        [Default: yes]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.4

- mode
        Mode the file or directory should be. For those used to `/usr/bin/chmod'
        remember that modes are actually octal numbers.  You must either specify
        the leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal
        number (like `0644' or `01777') or quote it (like `'644'' or `'0644'' so
        Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into
        number.  Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules
        will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.
        As of version 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for
        example, `u+rwx' or `u=rw,g=r,o=r').  As of version 2.3, the mode may
        also be the special string `preserve'.  `preserve' means that the file
        will be given the same permissions as the source file.
        [Default: (null)]

- owner
        Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to
        `chown'.
        [Default: (null)]

- remote_src
        If `no', it will search for `src' at originating/master machine.
        If `yes' it will go to the remote/target machine for the `src'. Default
        is `no'.
        Currently `remote_src' does not support recursive copying.
        `remote_src' only works with `mode=preserve' as of version 2.6.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.0

- selevel
        Level part of the SELinux file context. This is the MLS/MCS attribute,
        sometimes known as the `range'. `_default' feature works as for
        `seuser'.
        [Default: s0]

- serole
        Role part of SELinux file context, `_default' feature works as for
        `seuser'.
        [Default: (null)]

- setype
        Type part of SELinux file context, `_default' feature works as for
        `seuser'.
        [Default: (null)]

- seuser
        User part of SELinux file context. Will default to system policy, if
        applicable. If set to `_default', it will use the `user' portion of the
        policy if available.
        [Default: (null)]

- src
        Local path to a file to copy to the remote server; can be absolute or
        relative. If path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this
        case, if path ends with "/", only inside contents of that directory are
        copied to destination. Otherwise, if it does not end with "/", the
        directory itself with all contents is copied. This behavior is similar
        to Rsync.
        [Default: (null)]

- unsafe_writes
        Normally this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption
        or inconsistent reads from the target files, sometimes systems are
        configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example are
        docker mounted files, they cannot be updated atomically and can only be
        done in an unsafe manner.
        This boolean option allows ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of
        updating files for those cases in which you do not have any other
        choice. Be aware that this is subject to race conditions and can lead to
        data corruption.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.2

- validate
        The validation command to run before copying into place. The path to the
        file to validate is passed in via '%s' which must be present as in the
        example below. The command is passed securely so shell features like
        expansion and pipes won't work.
        [Default: (null)]


NOTES:
      * The [copy] module recursively copy facility does not scale to lots
        (>hundreds) of files. For alternative, see [synchronize] module,
        which is a wrapper around `rsync'.
      * For Windows targets, use the [win_copy] module instead.
