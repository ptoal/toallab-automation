<section id="Templates-Explained">
	<h2>Templates</h2>
	<p>Ansible embeds the <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/">Jinja2 templating engine</a> that can be used to dynamically:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Set and modify play variables</li>
	  <li>Conditional logic</li>
	  <li>Generate files such as configurations from variables</li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
	  <p>Templates are a vital feature provided by the Jinja2 template engine, a powerful piece of software independent of Ansible. Ansible makes this usage as seamless and transparent as possible. Most will not realize they are doing templating when they develop plays with Ansible.</p>
	  <p>We don't show any specific template examples at the moment because we'll have plenty of opportunity to see templates in action as we cover other topics.</p>
	  <p>In all actuality, what is covered here only touches upon a few of its most basic features. To go deeper see these docs:</p>
