              <p><strong>Ansible is simple.</strong> Playbooks are human and machine readable, no special coding skills required &ndash; and even people in your IT organization that don’t know Ansible can read an Ansible playbook and understand what’s happening.</p>

              <p><strong>Ansible is powerful.</strong> Simplicity is great, but to be really useful, you also need the powerful features that ensure you can model even the most complex of IT workflows.</p>

              <p>Together, Ansible’s capabilities allow you to orchestrate the entire application and environment lifecycle, regardless of where It&apos;s deployed.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p><strong>Ansible is Agentless.</strong>  Ansible relies on industry-standard and trusted SSH and WinRM protocols to automate. There are no agents or other software to install, and no additional firewall ports to open. With no need to separately stand up a management infrastructure, Ansible further reduces the activation energy required from your team to start automating today.</p>
              <p>In a world where IT complexity stymies even the most basic of IT tasks, Ansible provides a much needed respite &ndash; and path forward enabling teams to crush productivity-stealing complexity and overhead.</p>
